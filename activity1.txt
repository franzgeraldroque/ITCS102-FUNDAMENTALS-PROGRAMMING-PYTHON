Hi, I am Franz Gerald L. Roque, student from BSIT First Year Section 1A

This is my first file in my REPO.

I'm 18 years old from Mayao Crossing, BLISS Site

I hope I can learn the fundamentals on how to program and code this school year.

My goal is to master coding or programming to succeed in IT world.
